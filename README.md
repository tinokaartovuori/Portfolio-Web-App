## Progess so far

#### 26.1.2023

![](https://github.com/tinokaartovuori/my-portfolio/blob/main/documentation/progress/gifs/2022-01-26-portfolio-ui.gif)

Added some nice sticky UI elements. Later behind these there will be a nice Three.js scene and on top of that there are scrollable HTML content. The scroll will be synced with Three.js scene and HTML content and it will make a very cool effect.

Z-layer: `Sticky UI Elements` <- ( `HTML Content` <- `Three.js Scene` ) < These will have synced scroll behaivour
