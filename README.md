## Progress so far

#### 26.1.2023

![](https://github.com/tinokaartovuori/my-portfolio/blob/main/documentation/progress/gifs/2022-01-26-portfolio-ui.gif)

Added some nice sticky UI elements. Three.js scene will be added as background later and on top of that there will be scrollable HTML content. The scroll will be synced between the Three.js scene and HTML content and it will make a very cool effect.

Z-layer: `Sticky UI Elements` <- ( `HTML Content` <- `Three.js Scene` ) < These will have synced scroll behaivour
